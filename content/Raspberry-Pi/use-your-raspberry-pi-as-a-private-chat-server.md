Although <a href="https://diode.io/solutions/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Collab</strong></a> is a decentralized messaging / chat app that doesn't need a chat server, a Zone with just a few team members will often benefit from having a "Bot" as part of the Zone in order to relay encrypted messages to a team member who may have been offline when the message was originally sent.

You can make your Raspberry Pi into a Bot to ensure your chat messages are always delivered and <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/ad7s45khyq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>your files are always available</strong></a>, no matter the online/offline state of one or all of the other team members. This creates a highly available collaboration tool that is fully "<a href="https://diode.io/blog/self-custody-for-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>self custody</strong></a>."

Of course, any device (e.g. old phone, old computer, private cloud VM, etc...) can be used as a Bot, not just a Raspberry Pi!

To setup your Raspberry Pi as a Bot, follow these simple instructions:

1. <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/j8e4a8a59a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Install Diode Collab on the Raspberry Pi</strong></a>
2. <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/jkzakxo7a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Invite your Raspberry Pi to your Zone</strong></a>
3. <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/smyy5mok1q" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Change the role of your Raspberry Pi to a Bot</strong></a>

If you use external storage for your Pi, just be sure you buy a fast external drive! The lowest cost ones are sometimes too slow to keep up with a Zone's activities!
