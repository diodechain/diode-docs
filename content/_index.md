The Diode Vault is a tool that extends the presence and reach of your team. It relays encrypted messages on behalf of offline team members, backs up files, and provides a private exit node to give your team ex-region Internet access.

It can be deployed in the cloud or as a small box that plugs into power and Ethernet. Either way, it will extend the reach of your E2EE collaboration zones.
