Diode's blockchain-anchored Zero Trust DePIN network is the only open, permissionless "ZTNA" in the world.

<a href="https://diodenetwork.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>See here for the Diode Network's website.</strong></a>

Anyone can <a href="/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run a node</a> and anyone can create their own application on top of the Diode Network.

As opposed to other ZTNA solutions, the Diode Network:

1. Has global routing and identities - anyone can create and use a new device without registration
2. Is permissionless - anyone can contribute a routing / relay node
3. Has no fees for using the network\*

\* Using the network via third party relays requires a bandwidth sponsor.  The Diode Network uses the $DIODE token to underwrite bandwidth supply on behalf of application providers.
