The <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/what-is-the-diode-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Client</strong></a> (CLI) enables you to quickly publish content to the Diode Network, or to directly access content already published. It is a fast way to start interacting directly with the Diode Network from your local device.

The Diode CLI implements the [**Blockquick(TM) algorithm**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/features/what-is-blockquick-tm/), which enables anything running it to interact directly with compatible decentralized networks, like the Diode Network.
