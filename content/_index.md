Diode's leading secure collaboration product is a cross-platform messaging application that feels like Slack but has a higher level of security posture than Signal.  It is made for team collaboration and communication in sensitive regions and in regulated data environments.

The app doesn't store any data on a server and its three main capabilities are:

1) Secure messaging

All DMs and group chats are 256-bit end-to-end encrypted.

2) Secure file sharing

The end-to-end encrypted file sharing is like Google Drive meets a secure self-custody bit torrent.

3) Tunneled bookmarks

Web bookmarks use regional-access tunnels or direct-access tunnels.
