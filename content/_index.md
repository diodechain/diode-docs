Hi there - if youâ€™re looking for the future of secure communications, youâ€™ve come to the right place!

Diode's next generation solutions eliminate third-parties at all levels of the communications stack... without requiring self-hosted servers.

We make this available to the world in four primary components - each of which have an additional documentation area you can dive into:

1. <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io" title="Diode Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Network</strong></a> - an open, permissionless secure communication network that uses blockchain technology for security and scalability.
2. <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io" title="Diode Collab" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Collab</strong></a> - cross platform messaging app that is a secure replacement for Discord and Slack.
3. <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io" title="Diode CLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLI</strong></a> - a command-line interface tool that allows you to quickly build on top of the Diode Network and create capabilities that can interact with Collab users.
4. <a href="https://vaults.docs.diode.io" title="Diode Vault" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vault</strong></a> - a hardware device that runs both the Collab and the CLI and can perform duties like being a backup-device for your Zones or hosting a decentralized website

### **Diodeâ€™s vision is to transform the Internet into everyoneâ€™s private network, and weâ€™re adding daily to those capabilities!**
