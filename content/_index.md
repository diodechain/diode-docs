Diode's blockchain-anchored Zero Trust DePIN network is the only open, permissionless "ZTNA" in the world.

Anyone can create their own application on top of the Diode Network. As opposed to other ZTNA solutions, the Diode Network:

1. Has global routing and identities - anyone can create and use a new device without registration
2. Is permissionless - anyone can contribute a routing / relay node
3. Has no fees for using the network\*

\* Using the network via third party relays requires a bandwidth sponsor.  The Diode Network uses the $DIODE token to underwrite bandwidth supply on behalf of application providers.
