Hi there - if youâ€™re looking for the future of secure communications, youâ€™ve come to the right place!

Diode has four primary components - each of which have an additional documentation area you can dive into:

1. **Network** - an open, permissionless secure communication network that uses blockchain technology for security and scalability.
2. **App** - cross platform messaging app that is a secure replacement for Discord and Slack.
3. **CLI** - a command-line interface tool that allows you to quickly build on top of the Diode Network and create capabilities that can interact with App users.
4. **Vault** - a hardware device that runs both the App and the CLI and can perform duties like being a backup-device for your App zones or hosting a decentralized website

**Diodeâ€™s vision is to transform the Internet into everyoneâ€™s private network, and weâ€™re adding daily to those capabilities!**
