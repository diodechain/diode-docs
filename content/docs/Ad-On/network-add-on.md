Diode Collab has a "Network" Add On that is fully enabled in Enterprise Plans.  The Network Add On supports managing endpoints, domains, and contracts.

To access Networks in Zones, you must be the owner or an Admin within that Zone.

First, to enable the Network, go into your Zone's settings and scroll to "Features and Ad-Ons."
