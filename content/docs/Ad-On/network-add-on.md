Diode Collab has a "Network" Add Ons that is fully enabled in Enterprise Plans.  The Network Add Ons support managing [Endpoints](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/ad-on/network-endpoints/), [Domains](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/ad-on/network-domains/), and [Contracts](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/ad-on/network-contracts/).

> To access Network settings in any Zone, you must be the owner or an Admin within that Zone.

To enable the Network, go into your Zone's settings and scroll to "Features and Ad-Ons."
