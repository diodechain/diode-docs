Contracts are Fleet Contracts that can be used to manage and underwrite traffic for independent fleets of devices. A Contract is often deployed when creating a new IoT product, OT deployment, or application that leverages the Diode Network.

To view Contracts, go to the Network settings as seen in the quick access bar of your Zone.
