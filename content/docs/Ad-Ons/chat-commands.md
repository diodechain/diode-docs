See the Network Ad-Ons to article to enable the Network feature in your Zone.

Domains are "BNS" names that can be associated with one or more endpoints. A common use case for a Domain is to create a private publication group that is used to manage Team member access to specific assets.

To view Domains, go to the Network settings as seen in the quick access bar of your Zone.
