If you're wondering how to get different languages on Diode Collab, you're in the right place.

### **The Initial Download**

When first downloaded, Diode will load in whatever language is the system language of your device. For example, if your laptop has the system language set to Spanish, it will load in Spanish. If there is no specified system language, it will default to English.

### **Missing a Language?**

If you notice a language missing in our translation, we would love for you, or someone you know, to contribute!
