The Diode Network is a tunneling network that uses standards-based encryption and methods to create tunnels between any two devices no matter where they are at in the world.

<a href="https://contactdiode.paperform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Contact us</strong></a> if you want to learn about how Diode (or one of our partners) can host a private managed node on your behalf!

# Lite Nodes

The main communications fabric is comprised of Diode Network Lite Nodes.  These nodes can be created and hosted by anyone, and only require minimal resources. These nodes use one or more blockchain ledgers to lookup network definitions.

[Host a Lite Node!](/docs/)

# Full Nodes

Some Diode Network nodes also run full Diode L1 blockchain nodes, in addition to a Lite Node.  These nodes are called "Full Nodes".

If you have experience running an Ethereum or EVM compatible node, jump right in and download and run the node from our github:

* <a href="https://github.com/diodechain/diode_server/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Server Github Repo</a>

If you want something more "contained", checkout the docker project our integration partner, <a href="https://derateknoloji.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dera Technologies</a>, maintains for running a node on <a href="https://akash.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akash</a> (and other environments!):

* <a href="https://github.com/DeraTechDesign/Diode_Server_Docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Server Docker</a>

The project can use validator snapshots to accelerate the process of joining the network as a full node - join our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/diode_chain) to discuss
