Diode Collab has a "Network" Add On that is fully enabled in Enterprise Plans.  The Network Add On supports managing:

* Endpoints
  * Endpoints can be any Diode address and may of type "Generic" or "Exit Node"
  * Markdown endpoint descriptions is supported
  * Auto-launch endpoint dashboards
* Domains
  * Domains are "BNS" names that can be associated with one or more endpoints
  * A common use case for a Domain is to create a private publication group that is used to manage Team member access to specific assets
* Contracts
  * Contracts are Fleet Contracts that can be used to manage and underwrite traffic for independent fleets of devices
  * A Contract is often deployed when creating a new IoT product, OT deployment, or application that leverages the Diode Network
