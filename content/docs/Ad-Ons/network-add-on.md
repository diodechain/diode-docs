Diode Collab has a "Network" Add On that is fully enabled in Enterprise Plans.  The Network Add On supports managing endpoints, domains, and contracts.

To access Networks in Zones, you must be the owner or an Admin within that Zone.

First, to enable the Network, go into your Zone's settings and scroll to "Features and Ad-Ons."

Once there' click into the Network setting and select "Enable."

See our other articles on the contents of the Network Ad-Ons:

* Domains
  * Domains are "BNS" names that can be associated with one or more endpoints
  * A common use case for a Domain is to create a private publication group that is used to manage Team member access to specific assets
