Diode Collab has three types of plans that each Zone can subscribe to:

1. **Nomad** - The default free plan for individuals. We want to ensure individuals can achieve the basics of information self custody with the Nomad plan.
2. **Business** - A paid plan for teams who want to use the Diode Collab to enable their business operations.
3. **Enterprise** - This is a customizable plan for organizations who need to enable multiple teams, special features, limits, support, or billing arrangements. It is not a self-service plan, so please <a href="https://contactdiode.paperform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>contact us</strong></a> for Enterprise.

When a Zone is created, it automatically starts at the Nomad plan and can be upgraded to a higher plan via the Settings page. Here is a video demonstrating upgrading a Zone's plan:

| <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/add-a-team-member-or-additional-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Team Members</strong></a> | Team Members can chat with each other in an integrated environment that has access to their work content. Work content can include files, devices/assets, and dashboards/web content. Members can also publish web links and edit notes/files. Chat can be direct messages (1:1) or group chat channels. |
| [**Roles**](https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/manage-team-member-roles/) | Team Members can be assigned different roles, that give them different permissions. Each Zone may only have one Owner. |

| <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/share-a-file-or-folder-via-web-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Web Links</strong></a> | Web Links allow browser-based preview, upload, and download. They are used to share files and folders with others who do not have Diode Collab installed. |
| <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/invite-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Invitation Codes</strong></a> | Invitation codes are used to invite new Team Members to join a Zone (as opposed to explicitly inviting each Team Member via their username) |

### **Additional Enterprise Features**

The following features are in the Enterprise plans:

| <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/how-to-customize-share-page-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Web Link Branding</strong></a> | **A Zone's web link landing page (aka** <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/how-to-customize-share-page-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Share Page</strong></a>**) can be customized to use a custom logo, company name, and footer message.** |
| --- | --- |
| **Secure Browsing** | A Zone can provide bookmarks to websites or webpages that can be loaded in the Diode Collab over a secure link. These links can either be via regional proxy (e.g. load the page as if you are in the USA or other region) or via direct connection to the web page. This provides the Zone Team Members with a VPN solution for their Zone-related websites without requiring them to run VPN themselves. |
| **Network Management** | The powerful DIode Network is "under the hood" of the DIode Collab and is the core system that allows end-to-end encrypted communications without using . The Network Management feature allows an IT or technically-minded person to manage network routing of web pages, APIs, or other assets that you want your team to have access to. |
