The mission of the Diode Affiliate Program is to expand the use of <a href="https://diode.io/products/collab/" title="Diode Collab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Collab</a> in organizations. This program will reward participants for helping organizations to become paid subscribers to Diode Collab. This program is a collaboration between the <a href="https://diode.foundation" title="Diode Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Foundation</a> and <a href="https://diode.io" title="Diode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode</a>.

Diode Collab is the leading team collaboration solution for teams who work in sensitive regions or with sensitive data. It is a high security collaboration application organized like Slack, but with better digital protections than Signal. It also includes secure file sharing, regional Internet access (like VPN), and private dashboards â€“ everything organizations need to support protected team collaborations around the world.

Organizations who use Diode Collab get a higher security, lower cost alternative to centralized solutions on the market. Further, organizational users can easily create their own Zones for other walks of life - therefore organizational adoption represents a mutually beneficial sticky network effect for Diode and the Diode Network.
