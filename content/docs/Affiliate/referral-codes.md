Referral Codes are your key to the Diode Affiliate Program.  Each referral code is a unique identifier to your affiliate activity.  They give you the ability to register leads, record rewards, and introduce other affiliates to Diode.

### Getting your own code

First, fill out the <a href="https://nidese6v.paperform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest form</a> - we will respond with questions or with a link that you can use in <a href="https://diode.io/download/#app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Collab</a> to join the Diode Affiliate Zone.

Once you are in the Zone, follow these steps to get your own referral code:

1. Wait for the zone to appear and until it is fully initialized (can take a few minutes)
2. Navigate to the Registrar (or “registrar.diode”) and initiate a chat with it by sending “hello”
3. You will be prompted for your referral code - respond with the code you were provided or with a code from the <a href="https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html#regional-codes" title="Regional Codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regional Codes</a>
4. You will be asked to accept the terms of the program - type “I Accept”
5. You will receive your own Referral Code
6. You can now use your code to register leads and promote the Diode Network to others!
