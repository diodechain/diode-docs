No - only the Fleet creator can add/remove Clients from a Fleet.

You can use the <a href="https://diode.io/prenet/#/fleets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Network Explorer's Fleet page</strong></a> to view and manage your Fleets. If you don't have MetaMask setup yet, [**do that first**](https://support.diode.io/article/uec3mloh9z)!

If you've installed the Diode Client, it by default will use <a href="https://diode.io/prenet/#/address/0x6000000000000000000000000000000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode's Developer Fleet</strong></a> - if you want to use your own Fleet, you can add your Client to it after you've created it.
