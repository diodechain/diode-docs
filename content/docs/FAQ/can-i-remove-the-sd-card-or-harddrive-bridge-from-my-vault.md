This FAQ is applicable to Vault model 2312-NT.

If you remove either of those, your Vault will not function as expected until they are replaced.

The SD Card contains a standard operating system your Vault uses to operate - there is no special information on the SD Card, but without it, the Vault cannot operate.

The Harddrive Bridge connects your main system storage to the system controller. If it is not in place, your main system storage will not be available to the system controller and so most of the interesting Vault functions will not work correctly - such as Zone storage and chat relaying.
