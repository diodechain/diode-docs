Absolutely, the Diode Client can be ran on routers and computers - the Diode Network is the only decentralized network in the world with fully trustless direct connectivity to small devices.

One of the supported platforms is <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io/raspberry-pi/start-diode-on-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Raspberry Pi (Linux)</strong></a> - if you'd like to collaborate on supporting a specific router, please get in touch via our [**Telegram**](https://t.me/diode_chain) channel!
