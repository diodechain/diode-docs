Diode has four primary components - each of which have an additional documentation area you can dive into:

1. <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io" title="Diode Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Network</strong></a> - an open, permissionless secure communication network that uses blockchain technology for security and scalability.
2. <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io" title="Diode App" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Collab</strong></a> - cross platform messaging app that is a secure replacement for Discord and Slack.
3. <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io" title="Diode CLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode CLI</strong></a> - a command-line interface tool that allows you to quickly build on top of the Diode Network and create capabilities that can interact with Diode Collab users.
4. <a href="https://vaults.docs.diode.io" title="Diode Vault" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Vault</strong></a> - a hardware device that runs both Diode Collab and the CLI and can perform duties like being a backup-device for your Diode Collab zones or hosting a decentralized website
