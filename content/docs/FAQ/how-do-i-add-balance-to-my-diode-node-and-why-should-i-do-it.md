**How to add balance:**

Just send DIODE tokens directly to your node address (visible on your node dashboard). The balance will appear there automatically.

**Why add balance (benefits):**

* The network is transitioning to use DIODE balance to route traffic.,
* Nodes with DIODE balance will have higher reputation and be prioritized in the routing algorithm.,
* This is a precursor to node staking, which is under development.,

**In short:**

Adding balance now is the first step to making your node more useful and visible in the Diode Network.
