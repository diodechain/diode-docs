When signing up for Diode Collab as a new user, the first thing you configure is your Account Name - this Account Name is globally unique and allows others using Diode Collab to know with whom they are interacting. Of course, although your Account Name could be your real name, it can also be any other unique combination of letters and characters.

Sometimes, after configuring an initial Account Name, you may want to configure a new Account Name and use the new name as your Diode Collab handle.

You can do this by using the <a href="/docs/features/working-with-multiple-profiles-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-Profile feature</a> to add a new account, and then by <a href="/docs/features/working-with-multiple-profiles-accounts/#remove-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing out of the account you no-longer want</a>.
