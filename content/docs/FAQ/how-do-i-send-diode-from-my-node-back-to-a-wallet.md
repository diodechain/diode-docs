At the moment, you can't. You’ll need to wait for the upcoming “accountant” feature (expected within 30 days) to enable withdrawals.

Important: Any DIODE sent to your node will be automatically staked for at least one full epoch (except in version 1.6.0 and earlier, where it’s not auto-staked yet).

This staking ensures the network can route bandwidth reliably to your node.

Your node's balance and staking history help determine its reputation in the network.
