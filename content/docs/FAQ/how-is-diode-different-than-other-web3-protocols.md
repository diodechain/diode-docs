“There are many types of Web3 projects from blockchains to deApps, Diode is fundamentally a communications network. We are seeing a number of players in the ecosystem doing some great work developing frameworks to build blockchains. But Diode has a different approach. Diode uses a mixture of blockchain smart contracts, standards-based OpenSSL tunneling, and validator verification algorithms to create a uniquely available and secure network. This empowers developers to build data applications on top and build a better Internet. If you want to compare Diode with other existing projects, the closest would be dat-protocol, Ethereum-Swarm, and IPFS.

However, even for these projects, there are major differences. For instance, IPFS only works with pre-hashed files, so live-streaming and web conferencing for example, would not work. Diode, on the other hand, is a general network layer. It is designed to work for all kind of network applications.
