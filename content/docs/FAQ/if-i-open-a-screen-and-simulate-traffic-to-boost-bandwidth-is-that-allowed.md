Short answer: No, it doesn't align with the intended use of the network.

Why:

* Only bandwidth from underwritten contracts is eligible for monetization and points.
* Test/dev traffic (e.g., from contract 0x600...000) is excluded from rewards.
* Even if bandwidth appears to increase on the dashboard, only traffic with valid signed tickets under real fleet contracts counts.

Simulating bandwidth outside of real use cases doesnâ€™t help your node earn, and goes against the spirit of contributing to a decentralized, secure network.
