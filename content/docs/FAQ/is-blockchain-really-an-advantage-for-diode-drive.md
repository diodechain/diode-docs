Diode Collab uses the Diode Network, which leverages certain blockchain-based capabilities.

We're using the blockchain to register unique usernames, drive addresses and store drive memberships (public keys) so there is no central database or custom IT administration required to keep the system up and running.

The goal is to provide the convenience of a centralized system, without the privacy and security limitations of a centralized system.
