It’s important to understand that there are two separate types of activity in the Diode system:

**1\.  Zones (Referral Program):**

Points here are based on the number of active unique users in your Zone(s), not bandwidth.

Check your points in the “Zones” tab of your dashboard.

You earn ~1 point per active user, not per registered member. Just registering people doesn't count — they must be active.

**2\. Nodes (Bandwidth Relay):**

What you showed in the dashboard screenshot is node activity, not Zone points.

Nodes earn based on actual bandwidth relayed for signed devices.

If your node is not getting proper device signatures or real traffic, it won’t earn much, or any, points.

Many users are accidentally duplicating bandwidth across multiple nodes — this does not help the network and does not earn points.

**What you can do:**

1. Make sure devices using your node are authentic and signed (not cloned).
2. Try relocating your node or having it serve a real, active region.
3. Use the CLI to publish content or set up a Diode-based service to encourage usage.
4. Wait for the next points update, as the team is recalculating totals to reflect legitimate activity.
