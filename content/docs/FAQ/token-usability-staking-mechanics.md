**Q: What can I do with my tokens?**

Our token plays a vital role in securing, optimizing, and incentivizing participation in the network. Here are the key use cases:

1. **Bandwidth Staking for Projects**: Projects can stake tokens to secure dedicated bandwidth, ensuring stable and efficient data transmission. This helps prevent congestion and guarantees performance for high-priority applications.
2. **Staking Relay Nodes for Routing Preference:** Node operators can stake tokens to improve their routing preference. Higher-staked relay nodes are prioritized in the network, leading to faster and more reliable data relays.
3. **Staking DIDs for Access to Short DIDs:** Users can stake tokens to secure premium or short-form Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). This makes short DIDs scarce and valuable, encouraging long-term staking for brand identity or personal use.
4. **Delegated Bandwidth Staking for Yield:** If you’re not using your tokens directly, you can delegate them to projects in exchange for a share of their staking rewards. This allows you to earn passive income while supporting network activity.
5. **Future Use Cases (Coming Soon!)** We’re continuously expanding token utility. Some potential future features include:
   * Governance & Voting: Use tokens to influence network policies and decisions.
   * Content Prioritization: Stake tokens to boost visibility and distribution.
   * Service Access: Unlock premium features, APIs, or exclusive tools.
   * Reputation & Trust Scoring: Higher stakes could improve credibility in the network.
