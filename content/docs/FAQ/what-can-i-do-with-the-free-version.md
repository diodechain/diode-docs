Diode Collab \_is\_ a free app - you can add a theoretically unlimited number of free collaboration Zones, with unlimited numbers of users, for no cost!

Generally speaking, our goal with free Zones is to equip individuals, families, communities, and ecosystems with the means of secure and private communications.

Free Zones are made possible by our partnerships with the <a href="https://diode.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://moonbeam.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonbeam Network</a> in our shared pursuit to make secure communication available to everyone.

Watch this video for an example of a free Zone in action:

If you want to activate certain features in a given Zone, or are using Diode as part of an organization or for commercial purposes, <a href="https://diode.io/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can subscribe to a paid plan</a> for that particular Zone.
