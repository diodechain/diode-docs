A Canonical Member of a Fleet Contract is a Client Identity that has been added, via a transaction on the Diode Network, to the Fleet Contract.

Since Fleet Contracts are by default private (you cannot get a public listing of members), the <a href="https://diode.io/prenet/#/fleets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Network Explorer</strong></a> will "stage" a Client Identity in the Device ID list when one is added in order to test if the Client is already a part of it. If it is not, it will be staged and a separate transaction is required to make the new ID a persistent, "Canonical", Member.
