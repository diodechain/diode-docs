BNS stands for Blockchain Name System - the Diode Network implements a fully decentralized BNS using smart contracts to bind "friendly names" (BNS names) to network addresses (like Ethereum addresses). You can think of a BNS name the same way you think of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>root Domain Name</strong></a> for web2.0.

Addresses on the Diode Network use the same format as <a href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ethereum public addresses</strong></a> - while excellent for unique identification, they are not particularly memorable to humans. The Diode Network has a Blockchain Name System (BNS) - a decentralized smart-contract based Domain Name System - that allows the association of a human recognizable name with a Diode Network address. If a BNS name is configured for an address, it can be used in place of the address.

For example, this can be used to shorten the address used to view a decentralized media feed: <a href="https://0xc206e1255cbace8ba904daa259d7a5b7f90e2d50.diode.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://0xc206E1255Cbace8ba904DaA259D7a5b7F90E2D50.diode.link</strong></a> to <a href="https://live-stream.diode.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://live-stream.diode.link/</strong></a>.
