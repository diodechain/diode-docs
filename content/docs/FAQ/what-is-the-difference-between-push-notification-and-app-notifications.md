For information on enabling push notifications, <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/enable-push-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please read this article</a>.

For a primer on the privacy implications of push notifications, <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/how-do-notifications-impact-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please read this article</a>.

You can tell the difference between push notifications and in-app notifications because they are displayed a little bit differently:

* **In app notifications have two lines:**
  * the first line displays "\[Zone name\] - \[Nickname of sender\]"
  * the second line displays a snippet from the notification message.
* **Push notifications also have two lines**:
  * the first line displays "\[Nickname of sender\] sent you a message"
  * the second line displays a snippet from the notification message.

If you are trying to tell if push notifications are working on your device, look for the "\[Nickname of sender\] sent you a message" at the beginning/top of the notification bubble.  You can also tell if they are working because they will arrive even if your app is not running in the foreground or the background.

The following image shows the same message as a push notifications and an in-app notifications on Android.  The top message is a push notification, and the second message is an in-app notification:
