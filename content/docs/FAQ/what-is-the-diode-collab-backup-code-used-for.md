Your Diode Collab account's backup code can be used to restore your Account if you lose access to it for any reason. It is a secret code that you should write down and store somewhere safe as soon as you create your Diode Collab account.

The very first device that you use to register your Account has access to the backup code - it is the "master device." Subsequent <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/linked-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Linked Devices</strong></a> that are added to your Account can be removed by the master device. Additionally, a master device can block any new Linked Devices from being added. If you remove the backup code from your original device (for security reasons), or if you lose access to your master device, you can create a new master device by using the backup code to restore your Account on a new device.
