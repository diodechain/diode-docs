The Diode Network is a decentralized public communications network that enables edge devices and servers to publish and consume content without using centralized technology. It was designed to address the security and infrastructure needs of edge-based connected applications.

At its core, the Diode Network is an integrated blockchain implementation of The Web3 (server-less internet and the decentralized web). It leverages the [**BlockQuick**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/features/what-is-blockquick-tm/) algorithm to enable trustless communications with all types of devices and applications.

Communications over the Diode Network are end to end encrypted (unless explicitly configured not to be) and require only a minimum of computing and storage resource - <a href="https://diode.io/burning-platform-pki/blockquick-super-light-blockchain-client-for-trustless-time-19144/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>as opposed to other decentralized trustless technologies.</strong></a>
