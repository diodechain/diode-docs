Here are the top reasons people want to run a Diode Network Lite Node:

**1\. They want to help others connect E2EE in your region**

If even a single Diode Network node is running in a region, it can route the E2EE traffic to other end points in the region, or to end points in other regions. Adding a node in a new or congested region can make connecting using Diode more performant for endpoints in that area.

**2\. They wan to further isolate their own endpoint traffic**

Every Diode client can be configured to prefer/require certain server node routes. If you host your own node, you can also configure your clients to use your "in-house" node. This can give your application the same smart contract perimeter governance and global routing, but can also have better speed, routing privacy, economic benefits, and enterprise integrations.

**3\. They want to collect "traffic tickets" rewards**

All traffic in the Diode Network is metered, and "traffic tickets" are issued by the Diode Server node who handled the traffic and are signed by the endpoints who requested the traffic. These tickets are automatically submitted to the network by each node at the end of the month in return for tokens. The tokens the network issues are automatically added to the node's wallet and can be transferred at any time by the owner.

**4\. They are curious and like this sort of thing**

Getting going with a Diode Server node is an interesting and practical way to get into blockchain and to learn about one of the world's leading communications technologies.
