Syncthing is a great tool, but we also believe it's too difficult for the non-technical population. We are targeting a reduced and easy to use application experience that works for consumers and business.

Although there are other core differences in the way the technology works (and that impact how it scales vertically / horizontally), our goal is to make Diode Collab accessible enough so that even "grandpa" can use it.

We're trying to get as near as possible to the convenience of Dropbox/Google while being peer-2-peer and end-2-end encrypted.
