Yes, you can use the Google Play Store to install the Android version of Diode Collab on your Chromebook.

Please note that we have had reports (2024 January) that certain Chromebooks require a restart before you can sign up with Diode Collab. "*Before a restart, the app will run but will not allow you to create an account. After a restart, everything works fine."*
