The **Chat Policy** setting enables Zone administrators to control how members interact through chat within their Zone. This includes options for managing:

* **Direct Messaging (DM)** between Members
* **Visibility of public chat channels** for Members

### Configuration Options:

Zone admins can choose to:

* **Allow or restrict** Member-to-Member DMs
* **Enable or disable** Member access to public chat channels

These settings help admins maintain a secure and appropriate communication environment within their Zone.

### Important Notes:

* Even when public chat visibility is disabled, Members will still have access to:
  * **Announcement channels**
  * **Private chats** they are a part of

This ensures that important updates and ongoing conversations remain accessible as needed.

You can find these settings in the **Zone Settings** under **Chat Policy**.
