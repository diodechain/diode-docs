The Diode App is an E2E encrypted application for file sharing, collaboration, and backup that works for MacOS, Linux (ARM and X86), Windows, iOS, and Android.

It can be used to share a file or folder with anyone, regardless if they have the app installed. It can also be used to collaborate real-time with Team Members - friends, family, and co-workers who do have it installed.

Team Members all operate in a Sovereignty Zone where file synchronization and other types of collaboration and organization can happen. Each Zone uses Diode's high security, no-server technology that ensures the confidentiality and sovereignty of your Team Members’ digital footprint.

Here is a video that expands on these topics:
