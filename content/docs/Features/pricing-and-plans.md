A Diode Collab Zone will have different features depending on the plan it is subscribed to.  When a Zone is created, it starts on the default free Nomad plan.  If desired, it can be upgraded to a higher plan via the Settings page.

### **How to Upgrade**

You can upgrade a Zone by purchasing a plan - when you purchase a plan, you will be emailed a receipt code that can be entered into the Zone to upgrade it.

Here is a video demonstrating upgrading a Zone's plan:
