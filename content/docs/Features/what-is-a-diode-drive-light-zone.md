A Diode Collab "Light Zone" is a term used when you set the Zone's "File Syncing" option to "Disabled" in Diode Collab.

To disable "File Syncing," go to the Zone Settings in the desired Zone, scroll down to "Local Settings," and click on the "File Syncing" section. From there, you can toggle the syncing setting for your Zone between "Enabled" and "Disabled." In this case, you want your syncing "Disabled."

In this sync mode, the device will not automatically download files, or file changes, from other Team Members. However, any files that are added by the Light Zone device will be automatically uploaded to the other Team Members.

In Light Zone mode, the Zone will still show all of the files that are available, but you have to open the file in order to fetch it to your device.

In the header bar, Light Zones are depicted with a non-sync icon (where usually a check mark or a sync icon exists):

By default, when a new Zone is accepted by an Account, it will be accepted with File Syncing Enabled on your current device, but will be automatically added to any of the Account's other <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/linked-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Linked Devices</strong></a> in Light Zone mode.

Other functions in the Zone (e.g. chat, settings, file view) are the same regardless of the Zone sync mode.
