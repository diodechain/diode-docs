Developed by the Diode team, <a href="https://diode.io/burning-platform-pki/blockquick-super-light-blockchain-client-for-trustless-time-19144/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BlockQuick</strong></a> is the first super light client protocol for Ethereum that <a href="https://diode.io/blockchain/how-blockquick-super-light-client-protocol-can-help-mitigate-eclipse-attacks-19161/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>addresses the issue of man-in-the-middle attacks and eclipse attacks</strong></a>. It is capable of preventing attacks because it doesnâ€™t depend solely on choosing the longest chain with the highest difficulty on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) network when validating a block. Instead, it validates a block based on the "[**Consensus Reputation Table**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/features/what-is-blockquick-tm/)."

BlockQuick allows devices and application to directly interact with public blockchain networks. Unlike the current full sync, fast sync, or light sync requirements (i.e. a full sync typically requires more than 200GB of disk storage), through BlockQuick the device only needs a handshake size of 20KB to establish the most recent block hash. The design enables a client to sync up to a recent block with a consensus reputation table.

The implications of this technology are vast, ranging from the ability to <a href="https://diode.io/burning-platform-pki/why-we-cant-trust-network-time-19116/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>securely bootstrap time</strong></a> to the <a href="https://diode.io/dpki/how-decentralized-public-key-infrastructure-will-be-the-future-for-the-web-19148/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>full decentralization of Internet infrastructure</strong></a>.

Blockquick is implemented in the <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode CLI</strong></a> and other applications, like [**Diode Collab**](https://app.docs.diode.io/), from Diode and our partners. Visit those pages to download the applications and start interecting directly - and trustlessly - with decentralized network technology!
