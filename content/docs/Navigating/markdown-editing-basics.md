The Diode App has a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>markdown</strong></a> viewer that automatically renders markdown file formatting for the file [**set as the Home Page**](https://support.diode.io/article/3wu19hhldc) and for markdown files in the File Details and Web Link file previews.

For a complete guide to markdown editing, see [markdown.org](http://markdown.org)'s <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cheat sheet</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>other resources</strong></a> there.

Here are some Diode specific tips:

* Syntax: `![Name of Image](/Path/to/image.png)`
* Example: `![My Logo](/Brand/mylogo.png)`
* Notes
  * Only .png and .jpg files are supported
  * Zone file/folder paths must start with "/"
  * Paths can be external / web URLs

#### **Display an Image with Link**
