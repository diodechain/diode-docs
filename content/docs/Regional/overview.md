\# What is a Regional Leader?

\# Core Activities Needed for Each Region

Each region has its own peculiarities, thus leading to a tailored focus for every Regional Leader. However, every RL will have a set of core activities and goals that, collectively, will greatly impact the health of the network

\## Develop a healthy network of relay nodes

One of the core components of the Diode Network is a distributed and decentralized set of relay nodes, creating a layer of infrastructure that will power new apps and solutions built on top of it.

Each country and region might be different, so the target number will vary according to the region. It is important to notice that geographical dispersion is desired and the use of data centers is discouraged.

After a regional leader is chosen for a region, the team will book a kickoff call to perform a regional assessment and define a clear number of relay nodes. If the region is geographically large, then there might be additional details and requirements to the goal (e.g. node distribution...)

\## Create and Maintain a Regional Zone inside Diode App

Each RL should be able to create and maintain a zone for their region inside Diode App. Although discord can be used as their main communication platform, it is important to push their community to experiment Diode App, adding some folders and customizing some bookmarks.

\## Manage Community and Tech Support in Local Language

RL's will have a dedicated channel inside Discord for their region. The channel could be use to share updates, announcements and as a general chat as well. Although the main general chat could be used, the goal is to support members that prefers to speak in their native language.

RL's are not expected to have a technical background. If a community member has questions and concerns, RL's can translate/forward the message to Diode team and provide feedback.

\# Tailoring Goals & Objectives

\## Foment builders community

A region could or could not have a strong developer community. Also, if the RL has a technical background, they might have easy access to these communities and, therefore, promote Diode.

Builders are a core component of the Diode Network, since they are the ones that will develop new solutions that could potentially lead to more \[\[contract fleets\]\].

\## Hackathons

Promoting local hackathons might be a great way to discover new solutions and ideas of apps that could be built on top of Diode.

\## Events

RL's could go to exhibitions and congresses to promote Diode and bring more users and builders. Although there's a preference for DePin- or Web3-related events, other Web2 and privacy-related events might be suitable. If there are a local community that lives nearby, RL's could also promote gathering events.

\## Universities & Workshops

Universities and workshops are a great way to bring more relay nodes and developers to Diode. Some RLs might have great access to local universities.

\## Enterprise/B2B Adoption And Sales Rep

Diode App has been used by several enterprises and companies that prioritizes secure and private communication. RL's could receive additional training from the Diode team to become a sales representative for Diode.

\## Translation of Diode App and Articles

Being able to serve the community in their native language is a great differentiator for Diode. There are a few areas where translation is heavily needed:

\- Diode App

\- Blog Posts and Articles

\- Diode Website

\- Discord Announcements
