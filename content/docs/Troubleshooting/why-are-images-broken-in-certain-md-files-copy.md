After running the <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/how-do-i-stake-my-diode-tokens-for-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>console commands</strong></a> to stake Diode to my miner, my DIOs are gone but my staked DIOs are still 0 (checked with `Shell.get_miner_stake(me) `) - what is going on?

The Diode Network enforces a waiting time of 175200 blocks (roughly one month) as a safeguard against "hit and run" attacks on the network.

However, you can confirm you are mining via the shell `Stats.get(:hashrate)` - if you are successfully mining, the hashrate should be bigger than 0.
