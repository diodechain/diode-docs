***Maintain remote equipment over 256-bit E2EE connections.***

With Diode, it is simple to manage remote access to assets for your team and your suppliers.  Blockchain-anchored self-custody credentials ensure the integrity of each Zero Trust connection.

Devices can be remotely accessed via SSH, VNC, or any API-driven interface.  If the device has a local web configuration dashboard, it is simple to provide secure end-to-end encrypted access to team members.

### Advantages

* No server or network supplier risk
* No additional IT Admin or self-hosting burden
* Every team member uses self-custody keys (no account management risk)
* Easy to manage access groups (UI and/or DevOps tooling)
* Integrated web configurator dashboard access controls
* Access on-premise and off-cloud assets
* Auditable access control lists
* OT/service team communications available in all regions at highest security

### Applications

* Remote OEM equipment maintenance (e.g. air handling, lift stations, engine monitoring, regionally-restricted connections, etc.)
* Secure server access (on-premise, private-cloud, isolated public cloud)
* Blockchain DePIN node communication and management
* Building and facility management (factory floor, vendor access controls, BAM systems)
* Manufacturing line configuration, MES, and OEE
* Regulatory audit and compliance information sharing and support
* Remote file storage and intranet resource access
* Isolated IoT sensor communication and management tunnels (tunnel existing APIs from sensors in contested regions)
