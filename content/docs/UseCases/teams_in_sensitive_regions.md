<a href="https://diode.io/products/collab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Collab</a> is a secure replacement for Slack and Discord - it stores no data on a server and includes "ZTN" (Zero Trust VPN) access for your team.  No server is involved, and no self hosting required.

When using Diode Collab in sensitive regions, no VPN is required to maintain connections with your team.  It leverages TLS encryption (same as nearly all website traffic) and connects to random regional Diode nodes.  Its built-in ZTN integration provides your team with desktop and mobile secure browsing connections so they can maintain secure access to corporate tools (or watch the big game :-).
