Hi - we're glad you want to start using the [**Diode Network**](https://network.docs.diode.io/) - you won't be disappointed!

To start consuming content from the Diode Network, or to publish content via the Diode Network, see the sections below.

To read more about the Diode Network and related technologies, see the [**Useful Links and Articles**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/faq/useful-links-and-articles/).

Let us know if you have any questions or suggestions for this content via [**Telegram**](https://t.me/diode_chain)!

### **Consume Public Content via the Internet Gateway**

Diode hosts an Internet gateway at diode.link. Public content published via the Diode Network is accessible via this gateway at &lt;client-address&gt;.diode.link. For example, you can type <a href="https://betahaus-berlin.diode.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><code>https://betahaus-berlin.diode.link</code></strong></a> in a web browser to view streaming video from our Berlin office.

If you want to access Private or Protected content, or just want to access the Diode Network without using the public gateway, install the Diode Client (next section) and see the article about [**accessing Web 3.0 content**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/using/access-web3-0-content-run-a-local-gateway/).

### **Publish Content or Consume Private/Protected Content**

The <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/what-is-the-diode-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Client</strong></a> (CLI) enables you to quickly publish content to the Diode Network, or to directly access content already published. It is a fast way to start interacting directly with the Diode Network from your local device. The Diode CLI implements the [**Blockquick(TM) algorithm**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/features/what-is-blockquick-tm/), which enables anything running it to interact directly with compatible decentralized networks, like the Diode Network.

#### **Install the Diode Client (Diode CLI)**

The Diode Client runs on Linux (x86 and ARM), Mac, and Windows. To install, visit our <a href="https://diode.io/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Downloads page</strong></a> or run this command in a terminal window:

```
curl -Ssf https://diode.io/install.sh | sh
```

Once installed, type `diode` in a terminal window to get a list of commands and additional information. The [**Go Client Commands**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/faq/cli-commands/) article also describes the client capabilities.

### **Manage Your Identities**

All addresses on the Diode Network are unique and are used as identities to interact with the network. They can be used to publish content, access private or protected content, manage Fleet Contracts, and reserve a BNS name (domain name).

Addresses (identities) on the Diode Network are <a href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ethereum public addresses</strong></a>. In order to instantiate something persistent on the Diode Network, you must have an address, and you must have access to the addresses' private key - typically stored in a wallet somewhere.

Each Diode Client has its own wallet that it manages on the device the client is running on. However, there are many use cases in which it is valuable to manage aspects of the Diode Network without relying on a specific instance of the Diode Client - for these use cases, we recommend using a browser with a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MetaMask</strong></a> plugin and the <a href="https://diode.io/prenet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Network Explorer</strong></a> ([**docs**](https://network.docs.diode.io/)).

See the article "[**Configure MetaMask**](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/configure-metamask/)" to get MetaMask setup.
