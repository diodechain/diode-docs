Diode is the Swiss army knife of Web3 capabilities! One of the neat things it allows you to do is to publish a local website / webserver to the Internet where anyone can view it.

A common reason for doing this is to allow others to see a website that is under development - the development is done locally and can be viewed by collaborators remotely without setting up a staging server and without any IT tools / configuration. It is much easier and faster to just use Diode to publish your development website so that you can get others' feedback.

Using this method, you could also host a website long term without requiring a server, static IP address, or ICANN-registered domain name.

Have fun with this, and let use know in our [**Telegram**](https://t.me/diode_chain) channel if you have any feature requests!

### **Publish a Local Website**

If you already have a website running on port 80 of localhost, [**install Diode**](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/using/developers-start-here/) and simply run:

```
diode publish -public 80:80
```

This publishes whatever you see at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) to the Diode Network at &lt;client\_address&gt;:80. It is accessible on the Internet at https://&lt;client\_address&gt;.diode.link.

If you don't have a webserver already running, checkout the <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/using/publish-static-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode CLI's built-in webserver</strong></a>!

The &lt;client\_address&gt; can be found in the terminal output, as shown boxed in red below, when the command is ran. The line "Http Gateway Enabled" shows the full external URL - in the case shown below, it is `http://0x70114a27f3d1b549012498c69a4120ca4ea11e21.diode.link/` You can use that URL to share your website with others.

If you don't yet have a web server, [**Ghost**](https://ghost.org/) is a good option - see the article about [**running Ghost on a Raspberry Pi**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/raspberry-pi/host-a-website-with-ghost/).

If you are running a service on another port, for example localhost port 2368 (or - Elixir dev server usually uses port 4000, node typically uses port 3000), you can publish it to public port 80 with:

```
diode publish -public 2368:80
```

You can also publish on multiple different ports. For example if you want to show two differents sites, or publish a main site and a hidden admin area. For this the HTTP gateway supports the additional port ranges 8000-8100 and 8400-8500. This is an example publishing port 80 to https://&lt;client&gt;.diode.link and port 2368 to https://&lt;client.diode.link:8025

```
diode publish -public 80:80,2368:8025
```

### **Configure a "Domain Name" with the Diode Blockchain Name System (BNS)**

In the example above, the URL starts with your globally unique static Client address - a boring sequence of numbers and letters: `http://0x70114a27f3d1b549012498c69a4120ca4ea11e21.diode.link/`If you want to customize the name, you need to setup a BNS name to map to your address.

There are two ways to do this:

1. [**Configure MetaMask**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/configure-metamask/) and use the [**Diode Network Explorer**](https://diode.io/prenet/#/dns) ([**docs**](https://docs.diode.io/)) to reserve a BNS name and link it to your Client address
2. Use the Diode Client itself to reserve and link:

```
diode bns -register my-example-name
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Using the Diode Client to register the BNS name binds the the name to your Client's local wallet. Ensure you keep a backup of your wallet file at ~/.config/diode/private.db so you wonâ€™t lose access to the domain! If you want one location to manage all your BNS names, use the Diode Network Explorer method (you can use a MetaMask wallet, or hardware wallet, to manage all your BNS names). That allows you to, for example, easily link the BNS name to a different Client address.

Once you've created your BNS name and linked it to your Client address, your website will now be available at [https://my-example-name.diode.link](https://my-example-name.diode.link). Note that you may need to wait a few minutes for the BNS name to be trusted by the network.

### **Publish the Website Securely**

If you'd only like certain individuals to access your website, you can use the `publish` option `-private`to publish it so that only a single specified Diode address can access it, or the option `-protected` so that only Diode addresses listed in the same [**Fleet Contract**](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/features/what-is-a-fleet-contract/) can access it. For example:

```
diode publish -private 80:80,<authorized_address>
```

Run `diode publish --help` for more information.

When using these modes, each viewer must also be [**running the Diode Client as a local gateway**](https://cli.docs.diode.io/docs/using/access-web3-0-content-run-a-local-gateway/) so as to authenticate themselves with the Diode Network.
