## Multiple profiles

We now support multiple profiles! This feature allows you to create multiple usernames and choose which username to use for which Zones. This is useful to keep your username isolated to just the Zones you interact with through that account.

This is important if you interact with Zones for work, for personal, or for other purposes - you can have an account that is specific to each of your ecosystems.

## Make invite codes easier to copy

We added a copy icon for each invite code so you can quickly copy a given invite code to the clipboard. Happy inviting!

## Account information page

We added an "Account Details" page to the profile area - this allows a user to see all of their Web3 addresses in one place.

## Added "Quit" to profile menu

We added a "Quit" option to the in-app profile menu.  In the past, "Quit" was only accessible from the tray icon.  However, the tray icon is hard to find for some users.

## Fix: Allow app to start if profile path has unicode characters

One of our international users reported their application would not start up - we discovered this was due to the user having the Unicode character "Ã£" in the profile path.  This impacted any user with non-English characters in their username, for example.  This has now been fixed.

## Fix: Web3 bookmark launching

We introduced a regression in the last release that kept Web3 bookmarks from launching in the Brave browser.  This has been fixed.
