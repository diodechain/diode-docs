## Better team member stats

We've improved the stats you can see on other team members.  In the past, stats were limited to the online/offline state and the number/size of files they had.  We've added additional information, such as OS type and application version to stats so it is easier for IT support and Admins to help a team member who needs support.  Also, the stats shared are now persistent (cached) so you can see them even if the Team Member has gone offline.

You can find stats in each Team Member's Information page by clicking their name in the Team List or in any chat.

## Enable invitation codes on free plans

Based on popular demand, we have now enabled invitation codes (aka join codes) on free / Nomad plans.

## Add close button on tutorial

We added a little close "X" in the upper right side of the tutorial so it can be closed from any tutorial page.

## Fix: Re-enable About page on new Zone creation

We pushed 1.12.0 out with a known bug wherein a brand new Zone would not auto-generate an About page.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Some file pages create an error

We updated the markdown editor with an updated subsystem, but one of the modules it required for Chinese language parsing was not included.  Therefore, for some of our APAC users, certain folder and file pages would create an error.  This has been fixed.
