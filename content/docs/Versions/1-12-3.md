## Onboarding banner

We have further simplified the sign up process and instead now show an "onboarding banner" to prompt users to complete onboarding tasks.

## Fix: Windows - endless loop in restore Zone

The app was using two different file browsers - these were consolidated, but the new system had an endless loop on Windows systems in the "Restore Zone" function.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: 100% CPU consumption in permission check edge cases

In certain permission checks, the CPU could be pegged to 100% consumption depending on network state.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: New peer not accessible immediately

After adding a new Team Member to a Zone, the new member's information page was not accessible until blockchain anchoring had been completed.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Windows - error editing markdown files

Windows systems would sometimes experience a file conflict on auto-saves of markdown temporary files while a file was being edited.  This could result in the edit screen going blank.  This has been fixed.
