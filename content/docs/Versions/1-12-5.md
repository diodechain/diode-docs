Diode v1.12.5 was released on August 23, 2024.

* Features
  * Increase performance of non-sync zones
* Bug fixes
  * Fix CPU usage from constant zone refresh

## Increase performance of non-sync zones

The team dove into non-sync zones (e.g. if you join a Zone as a Read Only member) and improved the performance of joining and file listing capabilities.  The process of joining a Zone as a non-sync member will be more reliable now.

## Fix: CPU usage from constant zone refresh

We fixed a situation in which CPU usage would become very high due to constantly refreshing Zone information.
