Diode v1.12.6 was released on August 29, 2024.

* Bug fixes
  * Added retry for join errors
  * Make zone progress bar more consistent
  * Application crash

## Fix: Add retry for join errors

If the user has a poor network connection, the join process could fail to anchor authorization on the blockchain.  The join process will now retry if these types of errors are experienced.

## Fix: Make zone progress bar more consistent

The zone initialization progress bar has been made more consistent and performant - it now works even when joining / initializing multiple zones and it disappears more quickly if the zone is ready to use.

## Fix: Application crash

There was a native crash in the application in certain rare instances that impacted most OSes and platforms.  This has been fixed.  If you've experience the app crashing on you, please re-install the binary from the website (https://diode.io/download#app) to get this fix - an auto-update will not apply the fix.
