  * Fix: Double listing of members

## Add member count to All Members page

We added the total team member count (all roles) to the top of the All Members page.

## Fix: Double listing of members

When joining a new zone, sometimes Team Members would be listed twice in the DM list and Team list for a short period of time.  This has been fixed.
