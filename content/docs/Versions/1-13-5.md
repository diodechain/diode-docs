## Fix: Profile image setting

Setting the profile image was broken in a recent release - it is now possible again to set a profile image on desktop.  Mobile profile image setting is not yet supported.

Version 1.13.4 of the app had a regression in it that would not allow viewing of files that were added to direct messages and private chats.  This has been fixed.
