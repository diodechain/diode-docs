## New icon menu with quick access to web tunnels

The task bar icon on desktop has been updated - it now includes a list of most recently used tunnels so you can launch a tunneled browsing session quickly.  We also simplified the menu and no-long list all your different zones - you must open the app for that.

## Float toolbars over long lists

As lists of things have grown (e.g. Team Members) it has become hard to take action on a specific item because the action toolbars were scrolling up off the visible page.  The app now keeps the toolbars static when scrolling down on most lists.

## Warn that no notification will be sent if editing a mention

When you edit a mention after five minutes of posting a message, a warning will be shown letting you know that now new notifications will be sent to the modified mentioned person.  The app works the same as before, we've just added the warning so it is clear that new notifications aren't sent out.

## Doc link updates

All doc links in the app now point to the new docs site at https://docs.diode.io!

## Fix: Connection disruption when using community nodes

We introduced the usage of community nodes in 1.13.6.  However, this created some instability in connections depending on how stable the discovered community nodes were.  We've made connections stable again even if one or more community nodes are low quality.

## Fix: Layout issues on some mobile pages

Some mobile pages had incorrect/broken layout - these have been fixed.

## Fix: Alignment of quick access bar titles on Android and Windows

The section titles in the quick access bar were accidentally right-aligned in 1.13.6 on Android and Windows.  This has been fixed and they are now left-aligned again.
