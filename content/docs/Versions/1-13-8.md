## Add copy icon to Zone ID

The Zone Settings page now allows owners and admins to easily copy the Zone ID.

## Redirect to home when marking a message unread

The chat message "Mark unread" now redirects the main view to the Zone home when marking a message unread.  This helps with unintended clearing of the unread notification bubble.

## Fix: Editing chat mentions

Edits to chat mentions would sometimes cause strange looking links to show up in the edited message.  That has been fixed.
