## Add restart option to taskbar icon

The app can now be restarted via a menu option when clicking the taskbar icon.

## Fix: Improvements to archive, delete, create channels

Channel changes would not always immediately be shown after making the change.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Draft chat messages

1\.13.8 had a regression that erased chat messages-in-progress when you navigated away from the message.  This has been fixed.
