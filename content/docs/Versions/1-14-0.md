## In-app file and folder actions

The in-app file and folder actions have been expanded to support Rename, Duplicate, and Move!  You can find these actions when you hover over a file or folder in the files area - a small three-dot orange menu will appear on the item - clicking that will open a context menu with those options:

## Require PIN to view backup code

If a PIN is configured, your PIN is now required in order to view your backup code.

## Usage based billing

The app now supports usage-based billing - stay tuned for updates to pricing!

## Fix: Only show "+ Bookmark" to Admins and Owners

Although Members weren't actually able to add a Bookmark, the add bookmark "+" symbol was showing for Member roles.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Show all entitlements for custom plans

Some entitlements were not being shown for custom plans.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Don't hide toolbars when notification flashes

The notification that slides in to provide status updates on user actions was too tall - it got in the way of clicking on toolbars and other menu options.  This flash notification element has been made smaller so it is not in the way.

## Fix: Allow retrying the same receipt code

Sometimes, due to payment gateway delays, new billing entitlements are not immediately available.  In this case, if a receipt code is applied, it may not be initially recognized as valid.  The billing UI has been updated to allow successive retries of the same receipt code so that the user doesn't have to leave the page and re-enter to try again.

## Fix: Invitation code modal validation

When creating invitation codes, if one of the fields was erased, it would reset all fields.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Clean up Linked Device status messages

In the past, when adding a Linked Device, two lines pertaining to the same Linked Device would be shown as "In process" - now just a single line is shown.

## Fix: Cannot delete web links

Web links can now be deleted.

## Fix: Show receipt code for all plans

In the past, the billing page for custom plans were missing some details, like receipt codes.  Custom plans now display just like normal plans.
