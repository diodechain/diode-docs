## File sync policy

A major new feature "File Sync Policy" has been released to allow Zone administrators to set the file sync policy for their zones.  Now, Zones can be configured to enforce either "Two-way" or "Upload-only" sync for their members, or they can allow their members to choose their sync mode.

Before this release, members could always choose their sync mode.  However, many Zone owners expressed a desire to set a mode wherein their members would not be able to sync any files in order to reduce the chance that a member would delete a file or would add a potentially inappropriate or dangerous file.  This new policy setting allows Zone owners to disable file syncing for all members.

In a coming release, an additional mode of "Off" will be supported, which will also disable the ability for members to upload files.

Administrators and Bot devices can still select their sync policy, regardless of the Zone's File Sync Policy setting.

This setting is in the Zone settings under "File Sync Policy":
