Diode v1.14.6 was released on February 07, 2025.

This was a fast-follow bug fix release due to a breaking bug on mobile platforms in 1.14.4.  The new "Zone initializing check list" threw an error on mobile Zone home pages.

Admittedly, 1.14.4 was released without full QA testing due to the QA team being on Chinese New Year holiday in Taiwan.
