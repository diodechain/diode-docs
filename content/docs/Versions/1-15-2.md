## Allow join links and codes to be entered during "Add Zone"

Many users have been adding invite codes and links into the "Add Zone" popup and then wondering why their new zone's name looked like a web URL.  We decided to just to detect this and automatically join them to the relevant zone.

## Go to About page when Zone initialized

The app will now land you on a  Zone's About page when it has finished syncing a newly added Zone's details.

## Allow chat-files if only a single member in the zone

For lone warriors out there messaging themselves notes, files, images in single member Zones, we have enabled the "Chat File or Folder" action.

## Increase chat max attachment size to 300MB

You can now drag/drop files up to 300MB into a chat or folder.  This was important for a growing number of community groups using Diode Collab for image and video upload for their members in free Zones.  Dragging a file into the chat makes it easy to share / upload.

## Enable In Moderation invitation codes in free zones

Due to popular demand, we've enabled In Moderation invite codes in free zones.  Since a core value proposition for Diode Collab is security and privacy, many of the communities using Diode Collab's free zone don't want just anyone to join - they want to vet the new member first.  We evaluated the requests and have decided to enable moderation capabilities for free to support the growing uses.

## Fix: Stop file view reset on file-sync

There was a bug where the file details page (and some other areas) would "blink" and reset the scroll position if a file sync started.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Hide zone progress banner on global pages

When joining a new Zone, if the profile menu was clicked from the new Zone, the "initializing Zone" banner would be shown at the bottom of the profile page.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Leave Zone

The "Leave Zone" button in Zone settings was creating a user visible error.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Ensure custom plan entitlements use Nomad base

The Nomad base features were not being automatically merged into custom plans.  Now they are!

## Fix: Windows 11 24H2 support

Windows 11 24H2 eliminated a Windows system helper app called "wmic".  The installer used by Diode Collab depended on wmic.  Although the app would mostly function, some key dependencies were not installed.  This resulted in users on this version of Windows 11 experiencing strange name resolution problems.

Viva la Windows!
