## Discover page

New users have a new landing page for the app called the "Discover" page. This page shows community Zones that a new user may want to join - it is a great way to promote a community for others to see and join.

Every Zone created using the Nomad plan will automatically be published to this page when their Team Member count goes over three team members.  Paid plans can choose if they want to publish or not at any time.

All Zones published to the Discover page have an invitation code that allows others to join in a "In Moderation" role.  This allows the Zone owner (or admin) to determine whether they want to up-moderate the new entrant to a Member role, leave them in In Moderation, or boot them.

The page looks something like this, and will change over time as Zones are added and grow from the community:

## Don't sync chat uploads automatically

Chat uploads (files added to chat) are now sync'd according to the device's file sync setting.  This allows a Zone owner/admin to apply appropriate file restrictions for their Zone.

## Show Zone join progress

Newly joined Zones immediately create a spinning icon in the side bar so that the user can follow join progress.  We will be continuing to improve join speed in the coming weeks.

## Initial Arabic translation

An initial Arabic translation has been added to the app.  Please feel free to <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/languages-on-the-diode-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribute to fully building it out</a>!

## Banned files Zone setting (chat)

Every Zone now has a default list of chat banned files.  Any file type listed in this area will be blocked from being added to a chat.  Zone owner/admins can modify / extend banned files as desired.

## Disable folders for In-Moderation role

Folders are now disabled for In-Moderation roles.  In Moderation members can still be given access to specific files if embedded into a chat or the Zone's About page.

## Fix: Duplicated join transactions

Join transactions were always being done twice for every team member who joins a Zone.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Warn if user is no longer in the Zone

In the past, if a person clicked a team member's name in chat history, but the team member was no longer in the Zone, an error would occur.  Now, a warning is shown.

## Fix: Username help text

If a username is not found or has been taken already, better help text is shown in the Invite Team Member dialog.
