## Fix: File listing on file / folder conflict on Windows

It was possible for Windows systems operating in sync mode Off or sync mode Upload Only to create a local file with the same name as an unsynchronized folder.  In this case, the app could not resolve which was which and presented an error page.  A fix has been implemented.
