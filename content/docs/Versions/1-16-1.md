Diode v1.16.1 was released on April 15, 2025.

* Bug fixes
  * iOS boot for app store installs
  * Auto accept invitations
  * Chat reaction menu graceful close

## iOS boot for app store installs

A bug was fixed in the iOS app so that reinstallations from the app store would load existing profiles correctly.  This bug was never in the wild, but was a key reason iOS app store updates were so far behind (1.15.6).

## Auto-accept invitations

The auto-accept invite setting has been made more robust to auto-accept invites forwarded by other team members on behalf of a listed zone owner.

## Chat reaction menu graceful close

The chat reaction menu (three dots on each message) would not close gracefully - if left open and a click was made elsewhere on the app, it would appear to freeze the app.
