Diode v1.17.2 was released on May 21, 2025.

This is a fast-follow to v1.17.1 in order to fix some issues that escaped QA testing.

* Bug fixes
  * Fix shares not loading
  * Text overlaps the search bar
  * Enforce a character limit for file names
  * Fix channel name overlap

## Check online status before attempting to join a zone

The status of the app's Internet connection is now checked before and during joining a Zone.  If there is no connection, a new join will not be allowed.  If a Zone join is in progress, a message is now shown in the progress page alerting the user they are offline.

## Fix: Shares not loading

A regression was introduced for Web Links in which certain files shared via Web Link would not load.  This is fixed.

## Fix: Text overlaps the search bar

Certain pages had text that could overlap the pages' search bar if the text was too long.  This has been fixed.

## Fix: Enforce a character limit for filenames

File creation would fail if a filename with more than 300 characters was specified.  This limit is now enforced and will alert the user if the filename is too long.

## Fix: Channel name overlap in Zone search

If a channel name had more than 16 characters, it would overlap the search contents in Zone search.  This is now fixed.
