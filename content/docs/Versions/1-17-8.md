## Update About page links

The links in the About page were updated, including the addition of a link to the version history.

## Delete web links associated with deleted files

If a file or files or folder is deleted, any associated web links will also be removed.

## Fix online check

The online/offline check that will disallow certain functions if offline was creating false-positives.  The check was simplified so that false offline states are no longer created.
