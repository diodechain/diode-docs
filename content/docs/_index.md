The 2312-NT model is the first Vault model produced starting in December of 2023.

By configuring the Vault to auto-accept Zone invitations from authorized people, the Vault operates as a "Bot" in Diode Collab Zones.

It contains a solid state drive and a system controller running at 1.8GHz with 8GB of RAM and Gigabit Ethernet.

The "N" in the "2312-NT" can be any number and corresponds to the number of terabytes of storage that the vault has.

For example, a "2312-1T" system has 1 terabyte of storage.

MSRP ranges from $400 USD to $600 USD depending on the SSD.
