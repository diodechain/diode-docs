Anyone can run a Diode Network node (a Diode Point of Presence) and help expand the reach of the Diode Network.

> If you just want to use Diode, you don't need to run your own node (see the off-the-shelf [Diode Collab](https://diode.io/solutions/app) and the [CLI](https://diode.io/solutions/cli) ). However, if you DO want to run a node in the Diode Network, you've come to the right place!

<table><tbody><tr><td><h2 style="text-align:center;">1</h2></td><td><h2 style="text-align:center;">2</h2></td><td><h2 style="text-align:center;">3</h2></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">Get a Linux box</td><td><h4><strong>Install the node</strong></h4></td><td><h4>Use it!</h4></td></tr><tr><td><p>You must have a Linux box or virtual machine (preferably running Ubuntu or <a href="https://forum.diode.io/t/lite-node-installation/33/3?u=hansr77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows and wsl</a>)</p></td><td>Open a terminal and run "snap install diode-node" (<a href="https://forum.diode.io/t/lite-node-installation/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more details here</a>)</td><td>In the terminal, type "diode-node.info" (or "sudo diode-node.info") and your dashboard link will be printed out - you can put that in your browser and see your node's progress (<a href="https://diode.io/network/#/node/0x8f7d822ab91370880c9a0d5c467653a456a3f165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for example</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table>

That's it!  If your node is positioned near to users or devices, it will start handling traffic and earning rewards!

* You can see your node on the <a href="https://diode.io/network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall network map</a>.
* For debugging, visit the <a href="https://forum.diode.io/c/lite-node-category/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forum's lite node category</a>, or <a href="https://discord.gg/qdGCAKJdHs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out via Discord</a>.
* To boost your node's rewards from the Diode Foundation, check out the foundation's <a href="https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referral program</a> and, importantly, its <a href="https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/bandwidth_growth_program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bandwidth growth program</a>.
* **System requirements**
  * OS that can run <a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap packages </a>(Ubuntu supports Snap by default)
  * Publicly accessible IPv5 or IPv6 address with <a href="https://forum.diode.io/t/lite-node-ports/80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open ports</a> (most data center VMs have this by default)
  * 2GB of RAM (some providers, like Linode, run OK on 1GB of RAM)
