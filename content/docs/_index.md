Diode, as a verb, is basically "secure tunneling".  So, you tunnel by first deciding what you want to do and then doing it:

* **Securely collaborate:** [Download the app](https://diode.io/download/#app) and invite team members.
* **Publish assets / content**: [Download the CLI](https://diode.io/download/#cli) and run it along side your asset with "diode publish".  Access world-wide, but off the public Internet.
* **Earn rewards**: [Download the Network Node](https://diode.io/download/#network) and put it on a VM/device with a static IP address and earn rewards for traffic it handles
* **Contribute**: check out <a href="https://github.com/diodechain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our github</a>.
* **Join the community**: start at our [Telegram group](https://t.me/diode_chain) - or, if you are hardcore and want to start E2EE community involvement right off the bat, then <a href="https://diode.io/download/#app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the app</a> and<a href="https://diode.io/joinzone/#1MQKGI_TUYpNksoAAK6TSynBPpviy5MPgDRyTiO7YuGh5_H5sHDN9VIB1diC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> join the Diode Community zone</a>.
