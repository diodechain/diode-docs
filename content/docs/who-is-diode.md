Diode is a collection of amazing individuals and entities who work tirelessly to achieve a better Internet future.  You could be one of them.

Structurally speaking, Diode is two entities:

1. <a href="https://diode.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Foundation</a>: The Diode Foundation's purpose is to deploy world-wide secure and decentralized communications with the Diode Network.  In addition, the Diode Foundation is the Web3 operating entity and is responsible for the tokenomics of the overall system.
2. <a href="https://diode.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode</a>, the for-profit C Corp: Diode owns the intellectual property used by the Diode Network and provides the Diode app (messaging, files) to customers.

Diode was founded by Dominic Letz and Hans Rempel when Dominic started investigating how to fully secure the house-of-cards that is PKI.  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/579.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockquick</a> was born, NTP was validated, an open/permissionless ZTNA was created, and the pioneer self-custody messaging and file transfer app was developed.
