Diode is a collection of amazing individuals and entities who work tirelessly to achieve a better Internet future.  You could be one of them.

Structurally speaking, Diode is two entities:

1. <a href="https://diode.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Foundation</a>: The Diode Foundation's purpose is to deploy world-wide secure and decentralized communications with the Diode Network.  In addition, the Diode Foundation is the Web3 operating entity and is responsible for the tokenomics of the overall system.
2. <a href="https://diode.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode</a>, the for-profit C Corp: Diode owns the intellectual property used by the Diode Network and provides the [Diode Collab](https://app.docs.diode.io) (messaging, files) to customers.

Diode was founded by Dominic Letz and Hans Rempel when Dominic started investigating how to use blockchain to fully secure the house-of-cards that is PKI.  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/579.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockquick</a> was born, NTP was validated, an open/permissionless ZTNA was created, and the pioneer self-custody messaging and file transfer app was developed.  Both the company and the foundation were created in 2021.

The teams operate out of five regions: North America, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia.  <a href="https://t.me/diode_chain" title="Telegram channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Please get in touch!</a>
