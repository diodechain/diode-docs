Diode's mission is to transform the Internet into everyone's private network.

We believe that privacy is an inherit human trait and that the broken state of today's Internet (e.g. [public Certificate Authorities](https://diode.io/blog/why-there-are-3652-organizations-that-can-read-everyones-encrypted-traffic)) makes retaining digital sovereignty really hard.  This is surmountable for some enterprises and nation-states, but at high cost.  It is not typically within the reach of medium size organizations, and certainly not individuals.

Diode makes secure communications accessible to everyone.
